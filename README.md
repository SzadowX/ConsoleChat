# ConsoleChat
We offer a console chat messenger with the following functionality:
  - user registration - login, password, name"
  - login to chat using login/password
- sending individual messages to a specific user in a private conversation.
-view individual messages
  (can only be viewed by the currently authorized user)
  - exchange of messages between all chat users at the same time: by sending messages to the general chat.
           Note: since information is entered by different users from the same keyboard, control is transferred from one user to another through login/password authorization.
